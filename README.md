# dmm_util
dmm_util is a utility for downloading saved measurements from Fluke 289 and 287 Series multimeters.

This is a complete rewrite of [Fredrik Valeur dmm_util](https://github.com/fvaleur/dmm_util)  
Previous one was written in Ruby. This one is written in Python 3.  
There are also some changes to the code.

**Prerequisites:**

Python 3 and pyserial must have been installed before use.

many things have been added as we go along. So the code is not optimal.

**How to use it:**

./python3_dmm_util.py or python3 python3_dmm_util.py
This gives help.
