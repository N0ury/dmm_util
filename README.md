This is a complete rewrite of [Fredrik Valeur dmm_util](https://github.com/fvaleur/dmm_util)  
Previous one was written in Ruby. This one is written in Python 3.  
There are also some changes to the code.

**Prerequisites:**

**Python 3.10+** and pyserial must have been installed before use.

many things have been added as we go along. So the code is not optimal.

**Important**  
All the data displayed are those returned by the multimeter.  
None is calculated or processed


**How to install it:**

1. - Using PyPi (the simplest way)  
Latest **release** can be installed by typing:  
`python -m pip install fluke_28x_dmm_util`  
>You can run the utility:  
>`python -m fluke_28x_dmm_util -p port...`

2. - From github (newest version):  
Latest **commit** can be used by typing:  
`git clone https://github.com/N0ury/dmm_util.git`

>In this second case there are then two ways for running the utility 
>- without install
>```
>  cd dmm_util
>  python -m fluke_28x_dmm_util -p port...
>```
>- with install  
>```
>cd dmm_util
>python setup.py install
>or
>python setup.py install --user (if permission denied)
>```
>And then use with:  
>`python -m fluke_28x_dmm_util -p port...`

3. -  From Github releasehttps://github.com/N0ury/dmm_util/releases  
Get the latest release and unzip (or gunzip) it  
cd to the folder that has been created and run the utility as shown above.


**Common issues**
```
  File "python3_dmm_util.py", line nn
    match len(name):
            ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

You are using Python version less than 3.10, consider upgrading.

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "python3_dmm_util.py", line 4, in <module>
    import serial
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'serial'
```

pyserial module is needed.
Install it this way  
`python -m pip install pyserial`
